0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Learning Objectives

General
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm

Question 0
-Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

-Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

*in the best case
*in the average case
*in the worst case

Question 1
-Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);
You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
